This repository contains solutions and exercises for the SPA3 course, focused on Graphs and Trees.

The exercises include implementation of various graph algorithms such as bipartite graph checks, DFS, BFS, cycle detection, topological sorting, and more.

## 📚 Course Exercises
- [Vezbe 1](</Vezbe 1>)
  - Undirected graph implementation 🟢
  - Loading graph from file 📂
  - Find component starting from some vertex 🔍
  - Find all components and print them 🌐
  - Find path between 2 vertecies 🔗
  - Print distance from one vertex to all other 📏
  - Check if graph has cycles 🔄
- [Vezbe 2](</Vezbe 2>)
  - Check if undirected graph is bipartite 🔵🟣
  - Count number of components in directed graph 📊
  - Print all components 🧩
  - Check if cycle exists in graph and print one 🔄
  - Topological sort if there is no cycle 🔄

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java: Core language for implementing graph algorithms.
- Princeton's Graph Library [algs4j](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar): For directed graph representation and operations (Used in exercise 2 and forward).

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Clone the repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
- With git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/momcilovicluka/spa3-vezbe.git
```
or
- With GitHub cli (superior way btw):
```bash
gh repo clone momcilovicluka/spa3-vezbe
```
After that, just open exercises in your editor of choice (i use neovim btw (i don't i just say because funny)) and make sure you also downloaded example graphs files and algs4j library
